### Nuget config
To download the Goals.AutoUpdater package you need to create a nuget.config file in the root folder of the repo and add an personal access token(Classic) with read packages permission.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
    <packageSources>
        <clear />
        <add key="nuget" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
        <add key="github" value="https://nuget.pkg.github.com/goalsgame/index.json" />
    </packageSources>
    <packageSourceCredentials>
        <github>
            <add key="Username" value="USERNAME" />
            <add key="ClearTextPassword" value="[YOUR PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN]" />
        </github>
    </packageSourceCredentials>
</configuration>
```

### Config file
To run the app locally you need to create a config.json file and place it in the root folder (you can also put it in the `[AppData]/GOALS/Gamecure` folder)
(This file is ignored in the .gitignore)


### Generate using build tool
The config file can be generated using the Gamecure build tool. For more info run this command.   
`dotnet run --project src/Gamecure.BuildTool -- --help`

| Exit code | Reason |
|---|---|
| -2 | There was an error parsing the arguments |
| -1 | There was an error executing the command |
| 0 | Success |

#### CI/CD implementation
The out of the box CI/CD Jenkins implementation will not work, you will have to comment out `argoWorkflowHelper.triggerWorkflow(....)` sections in helpers.groovy file and the `@Library(...)` in the JenkinsFiles to get it to work.
